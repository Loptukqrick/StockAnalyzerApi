# StockAnalyzerApi
This API is used for gathering stock data and returning analyses on different asset types and how they can be compared.

This API is written in Python, and so a virtual environment has been set up to isolate the packges installed for this project
from the base Python system.

To activate the virtual environment: venv\Scripts\activate
  You should then see the prompt preceeded by the virtual environment name ((venv) $)
To deactivate the virtual environment: deactivate
